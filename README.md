- Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)
- True/False Questions

This project uses **NLTK**, **spaCy**, and other Python libraries to process and analyze input text, extract key information, and generate questions based on the user's requirements.

## Features
- **Text Analysis**: Extracts key facts and details from the input text.
- **Question Generation**: Automatically generates multiple choice questions, true/false questions, and descriptive questions.
- **Text Summarization**: Generates brief summaries of large paragraphs for easier question generation.
- **Customizable Question Type**: User can specify which types of questions (MCQ, True/False, Descriptive) to generate.
